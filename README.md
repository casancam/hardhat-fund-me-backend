# Sample Hardhat Project

Simple Smart Contract full-stack project. 

Functionality: Fund a smart contract with any amount of ETH and withdraw it all to the contract owner wallet address.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
